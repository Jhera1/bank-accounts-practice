// EXERCISE 14
// The balance is supposed to equal the difference of all deposits and all withdrawals.
// Check every bank account balance and return the array of bank accounts with a wrong balance
// Array example: bankAccounts in /data/data.js
// getClientsWithWrongBalance(bankAccounts) => [{ name: 'Name1', balance: 32, ... }, { name: 'Name2', balance: 3523, ... }]

export function getClientsWithWrongBalance(array) {
  // Your code goes here...
  return array.filter(account => {
    const totalDeposits = account.deposits ? account.deposits.reduce((acc, deposit) => acc + deposit, 0) : 0;
    const totalWithdrawals = account.withdrawals ? account.withdrawals.reduce((acc, withdrawal) => acc + withdrawal, 0) : 0;
    const calculatedBalance = totalDeposits - totalWithdrawals;
    return account.balance !== calculatedBalance;
});
}

export const bankAccounts = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Susan",
    balance: 100.32,
    deposits: [150, 30, 221],
    withdrawals: [110, 70.68, 120],
  },

    name: "Joshua",
    balance: 18456.57,
    deposits: [4000, 5000, 6000, 9200, 256.57],
    withdrawals: [1500, 1400, 1500, 1500],

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-14"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
